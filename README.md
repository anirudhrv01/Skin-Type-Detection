# Skin Type Detection

A deep learning–based system that detects facial skin type from a microscopic skin images using computer vision and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and provides personalized skincare product recommendations based on the detected skin type and user budget.

---

## 📌 Overview

Choosing suitable skincare products requires understanding one's skin type. This project automates skin type detection using image preprocessing and deep learning techniques. 

The system analyzes facial texture, brightness, and surface characteristics from a microscopic image to classify the skin type. Based on the prediction, it recommends suitable skincare products and filters them according to the user's budget.

This reduces guesswork and supports more personalized skincare selection.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Detect skin type from a microscopic image
- Use CNN-based deep learning for classification
- Apply image preprocessing techniques
- Develop a personalized product recommendation module
- Enable budget-based filtering of skincare products

---

## Skin Types Classified

The model classifies skin into:

- Oily
- Dry
- Normal
- Combination
- Sensitive

---

## Product Recommendation Module

After detecting the skin type, the system:

- Filters products suitable for the predicted skin type
- Allows users to specify a budget range
- Returns relevant and affordable skincare products
- Can be extended to include ingredient-based filtering
